# Covid Stats Maps

Simple covid stats maps

I know deaths are not a very "nice" metric to watch and of course it's sad, but I think it's critical to understand the real current virality and it's missing in a lot of infographics out there. This is why I decided to create this simple open source project showing a map with the number of deaths per country in the last x days. Hope this helps.
